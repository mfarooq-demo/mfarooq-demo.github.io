<h1>MY FAVORITE SPORT</h1>
<br>      
<p>Here I am going to tell about my favorite sport.My favorite sport is football.Football is played by a team of 11 players, and there are two teams playing against each other. It is played with a big circular ball which is kicked by the players with the aim to hit the goal.A football match is played for a total of 1 hour 45 minutes. This includes a 15 minutes break in between the match. So, the total playing time is 90 minutes. The match is played in two halves comprising of 45 minutes each.I support 
Brazil as my favorite football team.Brazil is the most successful national team in the FIFA World Cup,they won FIFA world cup five times in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002.Brazil also won nine times Copa Am√©rica cup.Brazil played first international match in 1914 .Brazil played in the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. There are maney legend players in  Brazil such as Naymar jr,Marcelo,Thiago Silva,Philippe Coutinho.There are also many legend retired players in Brazil whose names will be remembered forever such as Pele,Ronaldo,Rivaldo and many more .It is very popular and exciting game and I love this game very much .</p>
